# 311_Customer-service
This study explores NYCâ€™s 311 Service Request system to predict resolution times, improving municipal services. Using machine learning, it evaluates factors like request type, location, and agency to aid decision-making. Insights aim to optimize resources, enhance responsiveness, and improve urban living through data-driven governance strategies.


I.	Project Overview	



Step 1: Data Analysis 

   The first step involves a detailed examination of the NYC 311 service request dataset. This involves identifying the types of requests, their locations, and the agencies involved. Data visualization techniques are employed to understand the distribution of requests and uncover initial insights into city-wide patterns and service needs.

  Step 2: Handling Missing Data

In this critical step, we address the gaps in the dataset by applying appropriate imputation methods to handle missing values. This ensures the integrity and completeness of the data, which is essential for the robustness of the predictive models.


Step 3: Feature Engineering and Selection

Prior to model training, the dataset undergoes feature engineering to create new variables that could enhance model performance. Redundant columns are removed, and the most relevant features are selected to predict the time taken to close a service request.


Step 4: Creating the Models

Using machine learning algorithms, we develop models that can predict the resolution time of service requests. The training data is employed to build these models, emphasizing the tuning of model parameters to ensure high predictive accuracy while avoiding overfitting.


Step 5: Evaluating Model Performance

The final step involves evaluating the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 Score to determine their accuracy in predicting the resolution time of service requests. This evaluation is crucial to understanding the efficacy of the models and guiding improvements for more precise predictions.
